Var() Function in CSS :-

The var() function is used to insert the value of a CSS variable in a particular element. 

The CSS variables are just like simple variables of any other programming language. These variables are used to store values (like - colors) and have a scope in which the variables can be used. A variable is defined by using two dashes(â€“-) at the beginning and then the name which is case-sensitive. The benefit of variables is that it allows the same values to be reused at multiple places and updated/modified from one place. 

The variable is defined at a root level so at any level it can be access (its similar to the global variable). This CSS variable is access by using the var(function). As seen in below example.

Example:-

:root {
    --primaryColor: black;
    --secondaryColor: white;
}

h1 {
    background-color: var(--primaryColor);
    color: var(--secondaryColor);
}
